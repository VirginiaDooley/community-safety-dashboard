	<h1>Community Safety Dashboard</h1>

	<p>
		An interactive dashboard showing crime trends by type, time period, and location for community safety planning.
        As crime does not exist in isolation, I would like to compare this data with other data sources such as community investment and social services data, and other relevant data sources to provide a more comprehensive view of community safety. This data is currently limited to 2024 but I would like to expand this to include previous years to provide a more comprehensive view of trends.
